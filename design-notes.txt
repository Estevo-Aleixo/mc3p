== Basic design
Minecraft ignores the socksProxyHost system property, so my socks proxy idea is out.
Instead, I'll write a Minecraft-specific proxy.

Two independent threads: one for messages from server, one for messages from client.
Threads will parse the packets as they come in, and identify them.

Each thread will maintain a filter chain -- a user-configured list of filters. When a
Minecraft packet enters the chain, it's state is ACCEPT. Any filter may change the
state to REJECT; a filter may not change the state to ACCEPT.

ALTERNATE:
There's a total ordering on filters, but they must register for packet types.
The ordering is only important when two filters monitor the same packet type.
